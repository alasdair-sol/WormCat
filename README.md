# WormCat

## Overview
WormCat is a book catalogue system designed to help the average consumer keep track of their book collection. This system is designed with the average household in mind, where multiple people may own different copies of the same book. 

Users are able to upload and store copies of their books, record their location and shelf position, and modify the status of a copy (on loan to a friend etc..)

## Brief
I wanted to create an application using ASP.Net Core Razor Pages and Entity Framework Core, in order to gain some more knowledge in this environment. WormCat seemed like a good choice of project as it only required rudimentary manipulation of data, and didn't require the flashy advantages of client-side rendering.

The aim of this project was to simply do what it says on the tin - Catalogue a personal book collection.
